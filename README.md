# Production-Possibility-Frontier-Generator

The program creates a Production Possibility Frontier from 4 coordinate points inputted by the user. The user can also alter the variables, which changes the curve. The GUI was made using PySimpleGui and the graphs were made in matplotlib.

The Examples folder contains images that show sample inputs and the graphs that are created from them.
